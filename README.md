# getting-and-cleaning-data_coursera

This is the repo for the Getting and Cleaning Data project, a course from the Data Science Coursera Specialization.

A description of the dataset is available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The R script run_analysis.R that does the following:

1- Download the data if it does not exist in the working directory

2- Merges the training and test sets.

3- Extracts the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

4- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

5- Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

6- Creates a second, independent tidy data set from the data set in step 5 with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The final tidy dataset is saved in the tidy_data.txt file.
